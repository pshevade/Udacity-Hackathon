# Udacity-Hackathon
Project for Udacity Hackathon

This project is a version of the battleship game that can be played between 4 players.

The way we want it to work:
- A player signs up to play. Only one sign up per browser.
- Each player get assigned a color
- Once there are 4 players, the boards show up.
- The placement of the ships is random.
- The players play in turns. Click on the attack screen to fire at that co-ordinate
- If there is a ship at that location the player registers a hit
- ALL ships at that location get a hit
- The square where there was a hit get the color(S) of the players whos ships got hit
- If there was no ship, a white color appears.
